## Problem

Given a mathematical expression (that uses the operators defined below) as a String, return the result of the expression as a String.

Do not assume anything about the sets of the numbers. Any valid number can be used in the
expression (including but not limited to integers, decimals, etc.)

You need to support the following mathematical operators:
- Multiplication - '*'
- Division - '/'
- Addition - '+'
- Subtraction - '-'

Operators are evaluated from left to right, and '*' and '/' must always be evaluated before
'+' and '-'.

You need to support multiple layers of nested parenthesis - `( 2 + (3 * 5))`

There may or may not be whitespace between the numbers and the operators. However, the negation
operator, the '-' before a number, used to represent negative numbers, will never have a space
between the '-' sign and the number.

You do not need to worry about invalid outputs.
